<h2 align="center">About</h2>
<p>I am self-taught developer and competitive typist. I have been learning about software engineering for about 4 years, originally getting started for the learning experience. Mainly, I use JavaScript, Python, and Rust for my projects and development. I am currently learning about the following subjects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Ethical Hacking</li>
  <li>Docker & Kubernetes</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, I have been working on <a href="https://thetypingmatch.com">TheTypingMatch</a>, a minimal typing website with a stats tracker. In the past, I have built tools for <a href="https://github.com/Dapp3rCraft">Dapp3rCraft</a>, a small Minecraft smp community, and several Discord bots.</p>
